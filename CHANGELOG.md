# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Core term language (well-scoped, saturated primitives) and a direct
  evaluator over it (design §5.1, §8).
- Lexer with the unicode spellings and layout rule, parser over a token
  stream, desugarer with provenance, decimal printing, and the `eval` CLI
  (one-shot, file, stdin, minimal REPL).
- Canonical encoding and SHA-256 content hashing, the in-memory codebase
  (terms, names, history), binding groups with SCC analysis and Unison-style
  cycle hashing, so recursion and mutual recursion work, and the REPL
  commands `:hash`, `:names`, `:history`, `:view`, `:dependents`.
- Unison-style scratch: definitions are pending until `:add` or `:update`;
  `:update` propagates new versions to dependents in dependency order,
  `:upgrade` does so on demand, plus `:todo`, `:scratch`, `:forget`, `:edit`,
  `:alias`, `:unname`. Propagation is unconditional until inference exists.
- REPL `:load file` and `eval -i` (REPL loop over piped stdin, for scripting).
- Hindley-Milner inference over Core with let-polymorphism and length-indexed
  `Vec`/`Mat` (projection gives `Vec (n + k)` lower bounds); types stored in
  the codebase; static type errors with source excerpts; `:type`; `:update`
  and `:upgrade` now leave dependents that no longer typecheck on their old
  version and say why. No dimensions or operator overloading yet.
- Typed Core: System F style terms with annotated binders and explicit type
  and length abstraction/application, produced by elaboration, checked by a
  Core-Lint-style `lint` before storage or evaluation, and run by the
  evaluator (which erases the type forms). `:core name` prints it.
- Kinded type variables (`Type`, `Len`, `Shape`) with one abstraction and one
  application form in Typed Core; `Vec`/`Mat` replaced by `Tensor shape`, with
  `Num` the rank-zero case; `Lit` is a constant tensor and `Pack` a
  construction, `MatLit` removed; `+ - neg abs vmap ==` are shape-polymorphic;
  `dot`, `cross`, `transpose` and `vmap` evaluate; tensors are flat row-major
  buffers at runtime. `:lint name`.
- Products as first-class tensor operators, each with one type: `*`/`⊗`
  (tensor product, covering scalar scaling), `·`/`@` (contracting product:
  dot, matrix-vector, matrix-matrix), `×`/`><` (cross), `⊙`/`.*` and `⊘`/`./`
  (elementwise), `/` (scalar divisor). Shape concatenation is a deferred
  constraint, defaulted at generalisation (unknown-rank left operand is a
  scalar for `*`, a vector for `·`). `×` now means cross product.
- `==`/`/=` are the one overloaded primitive, over tensors and `Bool`, via an
  instance constraint on the same solver; comparing functions is a static
  error. `within`/`sigma` are the prefix names of `±`/`±σ`.
- Property tests over random surface programs: inference ⇒ lint with equal
  types, printed Core re-parses alpha-equivalent, hashes ignore hints and
  survive printing, linted terms never hit an internal error, inference is
  deterministic. They found and fixed two things: a binder hint shadowing a
  free name printed ambiguously (binders are now freshened), and `-3`
  desugaring differently from a negative literal (negation of a constant is
  now the negative constant).
