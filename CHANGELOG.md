# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Core term language (well-scoped, saturated primitives) and a direct
  evaluator over it (design §5.1, §8).
- Lexer with the unicode spellings and layout rule, parser over a token
  stream, desugarer with provenance, decimal printing, and the `eval` CLI
  (one-shot, file, stdin, minimal REPL).
- Canonical encoding and SHA-256 content hashing, the in-memory codebase
  (terms, names, history), binding groups with SCC analysis and Unison-style
  cycle hashing, so recursion and mutual recursion work, and the REPL
  commands `:hash`, `:names`, `:history`, `:view`, `:dependents`.
- Unison-style scratch: definitions are pending until `:add` or `:update`;
  `:update` propagates new versions to dependents in dependency order,
  `:upgrade` does so on demand, plus `:todo`, `:scratch`, `:forget`, `:edit`,
  `:alias`, `:unname`. Propagation is unconditional until inference exists.
- REPL `:load file` and `eval -i` (REPL loop over piped stdin, for scripting).
- Hindley-Milner inference over Core with let-polymorphism and length-indexed
  `Vec`/`Mat` (projection gives `Vec (n + k)` lower bounds); types stored in
  the codebase; static type errors with source excerpts; `:type`; `:update`
  and `:upgrade` now leave dependents that no longer typecheck on their old
  version and say why. No dimensions or operator overloading yet.
- Typed Core: System F style terms with annotated binders and explicit type
  and length abstraction/application, produced by elaboration, checked by a
  Core-Lint-style `lint` before storage or evaluation, and run by the
  evaluator (which erases the type forms). `:core name` prints it.
- Kinded type variables (`Type`, `Len`, `Shape`) with one abstraction and one
  application form in Typed Core; `Vec`/`Mat` replaced by `Tensor shape`, with
  `Num` the rank-zero case; `Lit` is a constant tensor and `Pack` a
  construction, `MatLit` removed; `+ - neg abs vmap ==` are shape-polymorphic;
  `dot`, `cross`, `transpose` and `vmap` evaluate; tensors are flat row-major
  buffers at runtime. `:lint name`.
- Products as first-class tensor operators, each with one type: `*`/`⊗`
  (tensor product, covering scalar scaling), `·`/`@` (contracting product:
  dot, matrix-vector, matrix-matrix), `×`/`><` (cross), `⊙`/`.*` and `⊘`/`./`
  (elementwise), `/` (scalar divisor). Shape concatenation is a deferred
  constraint, defaulted at generalisation (unknown-rank left operand is a
  scalar for `*`, a vector for `·`). `×` now means cross product.
- `==`/`/=` are the one overloaded primitive, over tensors and `Bool`, via an
  instance constraint on the same solver; comparing functions is a static
  error. `within`/`sigma` are the prefix names of `±`/`±σ`.
- Property tests over random surface programs: inference ⇒ lint with equal
  types, printed Core re-parses alpha-equivalent, hashes ignore hints and
  survive printing, linted terms never hit an internal error, inference is
  deterministic. They found and fixed two things: a binder hint shadowing a
  free name printed ambiguously (binders are now freshened), and `-3`
  desugaring differently from a negative literal (negation of a constant is
  now the negative constant). **Hash-affecting**: definitions containing a
  negated constant change hash.
- Dimensions in the type system: `Tensor s δ` with a `Dim` kind, Kennedy's
  unification, dimension-polymorphic primitives (`sqrt : Num [d^2] -> Num d`,
  `\r -> r^2 : Num d -> Num [d^2]`), the seven SI base units as primitives,
  runtime dimension vectors and printing in base units (`9.81 m s^-2`).
  Static errors name the residual: "dimensions differ by [m s^-1]". Lint's
  instance matching uses a one-shot substitution, fixing a namespace clash
  between a scheme's ids and inference's. Display units and the prelude are
  next.
- Prelude: derived SI units, the 24 prefixes on every prefixable unit,
  accepted units (min h day year L t g AU), exact SI-2019 and IAU nominal
  constants, the Levi-Civita tensor, generated from `Eval.Prelude` and entered
  into every session as one binding group (about 700 definitions, ~30 ms).
- Wedge product `∧`/`/\` (`wedge`) and 3D Hodge star `⋆` (`star`) as
  primitives; `cross` is now a prelude definition `star (wedge a b)` and `×`
  resolves through that name. `∧` therefore no longer spells boolean and,
  which is `&&` only. Units print in the customary order `kg m s …`.
- Display units: `unit name = e` declares a definition as a display unit
  (codebase metadata beside names, carried through `:update`); values carry
  a display unit through products, quotients, powers and sums (left operand
  wins) and print in it: `5 km / h` is `5 km h^-1`, `3 h + 30 min` is `3.5 h`,
  `1 AU / c to min` converts. The prelude declares its units with `unit`; `Bq`
  and `Sv` are defined through `Hz` and `Gy` so identical definitions do not
  merge their names.
- Affine arithmetic (design §3.2): tensor elements are now magnitudes, exact
  rationals or affine forms `mid + Σ cᵢ·eᵢ ± slack` whose nudges have a kind
  (bound or 1σ) and a content-addressed identity, so `x - x`, `sin 1 - sin 1`
  and `y / y` are exactly `0`, `0` and `1`. All elementary functions (`sqrt
  exp log sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 sinh cosh tanh pi`) with rigorous
  error bounds from rational series; `norm`, `det` and `inverse`; `±`, `±σ`,
  `noise n`, `gauss n` with definition-site identity; comparisons and integer
  rounding fail with "cannot decide" instead of guessing (`:set sigma k`);
  certain-digit printing (`sin 1` is `0.84147098480789650665…`, `5 ± 0.1`,
  `G` is `6.67430e-11 ±σ 1.5e-15 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2`), `:exact`, `:budget`,
  `:set scale n`. Working precision is `scale + 4` digits, absolute or
  relative whichever is tighter, so Planck-scale quantities keep their
  digits. Prelude: `G` with its CODATA σ, `M_earth` and `M_sun` derived from
  the nominal `GM` values, `deg`, `arcmin`, `arcsec`. Fixed: unifying `d^2`
  with a non-square dimension (`sqrt (1 kg)`) looped forever; it is now a
  type error.
